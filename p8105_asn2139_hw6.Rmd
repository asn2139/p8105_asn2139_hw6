### Problem 1

### Problem 2

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

```{r}

birth_weight_df = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") 
```


Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two. Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals against fitted values â€“ use add_predictions and add_residuals in making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)
One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these
Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

### Problem 3

```{r}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```
